This here functions as a cover page and record of all the *aRt of the Figure* workshops. Each iteration has had a slightly different structure, length and topic coverage - ranging from anything between short intros to programming, advanced dataviz and interactive graphs, data wrangling, and text/corpus linguistics. Besides standalone events, venues have included summer schools, academic retreats, invited lectures, and international conferences and hackathons, so far in 5 countries across Europe. The workshops have been primarily based on the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language.

As a humanities scholar myself, I specialize in helping humanities and social science scholars and others with little to no coding experience get started with **programming - the ultimate transferable skill**, the way I see it - infinitely useful both for doing science and for those planning to move to industry, and in general, for saving time on repetitive tasks and making one's life easier. My day job (which takes most of my time) is being a researcher, currently at the [CUDAN Lab](https://cudan.tlu.ee/), where I use the skills that I teach in my research on a daily basis.

The focus of most of the workshops has been **data visualization**. Why? Because (1) I believe data visualization is an integral component of doing science, and (2) it's more fun to learn programming when you can immedately see and interpret the results of your first coding attempts (and making nice plots in R is very easy and intuitive, especially with packages like ggplot2; see [here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) for inspiration).

If you have **signed up** to one of the workshops, you should have received an email ahead of time with instructions; if you are here because you signed up but did not get an email, contact me or the organizing party to make sure you are registered. All materials are also listed below. If you're thinking of **inviting me to teach or consult** (online of offline), see the details below and feel free to get in touch to discuss options.

### Ordering a custom workshop

If our interests overlap, then I'd be happy to tailor a course, workshop or hackathon to suit the learning needs, data and interests of you and your colleagues or students. I occasionally also do data science related consulting. There are a few different options to cover expenses related to the preparation, delivery, and travel in the case of on-site events. If your organization has internal funding for external/guest lecturers and workshops, then I can simply issue a bill for the service (through my PLC consultancy, Datafigure OÜ). If you are an educational institution, then this could be potentially funded through a joint application to Erasmus+. Past workshops have also been funded by combinations of similar programmes and university travel grants. Feel free to get in touch to discuss options.

Below is a little showcase of the kinds of plots and figures you could learn to create if you participated in one of the workshops, from simple plots to complex graphs, interactive applets and zoomable maps (content depending on the length and focus of a given workshop). <br> Check [my website](https://andreskarjus.github.io/) for more details on consulting, bookings and past workshops. If you like the materials and would like to invite me to come and teach you and/or your students how to do all this (in an easy-to-learn, efficient and reproducible manner), feel free to get in touch to discuss options.
