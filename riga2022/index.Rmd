**Welcome to the pre-workshop prep page!**<br>
Please follow these instructions to download and install the necessary software and files on your laptop before the workshop. All this will take some time, perhaps around 15-30min, depending on your prior familiarity with software installation and R.<br> 
Note that it is _not_ enough to have just R and tidyverse installed (which you might have) - you will also need a number of _packages_ and a _worksheet file_, and your R and RStudio should be up to date. The instructions below come with troubleshooting steps - if something seems to be amiss or not working as intended, make sure you've read through everything. Importantly, if something went wrong and you could not install the software, please get in touch before the workshop starts so we can try to quickly troubleshoot ("just watching" in the workshop is not an option, I want to teach you how to actually do some things :)

The first part of these instructions is identical regardless if you're attending Day 1, Day 2, or both. The last part (worksheet and package installation) depends which you're attending. If you signed up for both days, make sure to download both worksheets below and install both package sets!

Good luck! <br>

**This document contains step-by-step instructions for:**

1. Installing the (free) software we will be using;
2. Configuring RStudio options;
3. Downloading the worksheet file(s) you'll be working with and <br>
   Installing the required packages (instructions inside the worksheets).
4. Troubleshooting the top most common errors (something to read during package installation)
5. Confirm doing all the steps.

**All steps are mandatory and must be completed before the workshop starts.** Step 1 can be skipped if (and only if) you've very recently installed R and RStudio, for example for another R workshop. There's a known conflict between the newer R versions and older RStudio (pre-1.4.1717), so you're quaranteed to crash if you update one but not the other.


# Install the software

The installation process only takes a few clicks. But before you start, *please* make sure your operating system is up to date as well (particularly Macs: there are known conflicts between old versions of R and some newer packages, which will manifest if you have a Mac with an very old version of the Mac OS, which in turn would lead you to download an old version of R).<br>
You need *both* R and the RStudio IDE. R will be running inside of Rstudio. If you only install RStudio but not R, it's not going to work.

## Install R

First let's install R. If you **already have R installed, please still update** it to the most recent version, i.e. `4.2.1`. Updating is done just by downloading the most recent version and re-installing. Depending on your operating system, go to:

- https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ - for Windows
- https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ - for Mac (the first link under "Latest release")
- https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ - for Linux

If you already have R and/or RStudio installed, close both applications before updating. Download the relevant file above and install (with default options, just keep clicking Next). Run R once to see that it works (something like `Rgui.exe` or `R x64.exe` should appear as a shortcut in the start menu and/or desktop; on a Mac, look for the R application in Finder). It should look something like this, depending on your OS:

![on a Mac](../rmac.png){width=200px}  ![on Windows](../rwin.JPG){width=200px}

Good job. Now close R (if it asks to save the workspace, say no). This is the last time you see this interface, RStudio is much nicer :)


## Install RStudio

Did you install R? Great; now go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download -> it should detect your operating system and offer the relevant version ("Download RStudio Desktop"), otherwise choose the installer from the list depending on your operating system (so *not* the zip/tarball, and not the source code!). Even if you have an older version of RStudio installed, update it anyway (don't worry, your settings and preferences carry over).
<br> Once installed, run RStudio (again, look for the shortcut in Start Menu/Finder, or the desktop, or the folder where you installed it).

Common issues and troubleshooting - skip if RStudio installed and runs ok:

- **If you cannot install RStudio** because your operating system is out of date (e.g. pre-7 Windows or pre-Sierra Mac OS) and you don't feel like or don't have the time or willpower to upgrade, a solution is to use **RStudio Cloud** instead in a web browser.
    - Go to https://rstudio.cloud and sign up a free account, or just log in with Google or Github.
    - Download the Rmd file (step 4 below), and upload it to the cloud (see File pane -> Upload in RStudio Cloud). Make sure to still do the package installation step as instructed in the worksheet.
    - Doing these steps allows you to participate without installing RStudio, provided you're on a decent internet connection.
- Another option if you can't install RStudio, and if (and only if) it's because you're using a 32-bit version of Windows (likely an older laptop; installer says *Windows is not compatible*), you could download this [old archived version](http://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.463.exe) instead - the newest version of RStudio installer comes only in the 64-bit flavour.
- If RStudio is running but very slow: try disabling the spellchecker: *Tools* -> *Global Options*, choose the *Spelling* tab on the left, disable the real-time speller.
- If you're on a Mac and got the *Error reading R script (), system error 2 (No such file or directory); Unable to find libR.dylib*, it means you only installed the RStudio IDE but didn't install R. Just go back to 1.1 and do that.

# Configure RStudio options

Run the RStudio application. We need to change one option to make it behave in a more useful way for us (fortunately, the RStudio interface is highly customizable).

- Enable Soft Wrap: on the top toolbar, go to _Code_ menu on the top left, and enable the `Soft-wrap Long Lines` option. This will make using the script editor much easier, by wrapping long lines so you won't have to keep scrolling left and right all the time.
- Absolutely optional, only if you're bored: feel free to play with the settings in the Appearance tab in Tools -> Global Options (I personally prefer the dark themes for example).

# Download the worksheet and install packages

- You will need to download an .Rmd R Markdown script file for the workshop. 
- The two days have different scripts. 
- Choose the one you're going to attend; if you're attending _both_, then you need to _download both files_, and follow instructions in _both_ of them - the instructions look similar, but the two days use a slightly different set of packages. The exercises will be entirely different of course.

- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreskarjus/artofthefigure/master/riga2022/dataviz_worksheet_day1.zip" download target="_blank">Day 1, click here</a> *(Importing, exploring and visualizing multilingual data in R)*.
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreskarjus/artofthefigure/master/riga2022/dataviz_worksheet_day2.zip" download target="_blank">Day 2, click here</a> *(Working with text in R)*.
- (if just clicking the link doesn't work, you might need to right click and choose Save As or similar)

- The downloads are zipped/compressed files: unpack them into a convenient location - there's a single dataviz_worksheet.Rmd file in each (as illustrated below).
- Once unpacked, double-click the _dataviz_worksheet.Rmd_ file to open it (make sure you unpacked it first, don't run it from inside the compressed folder). If RStudio is properly installed, the icon of the file should be a blue badge with the letter "R" in it, and double-clicking the file should open it in RStudio. If clicking it gives you an "Open with..." dialog, just browse for the RStudio application to open it.<br>

- Follow the instructions in the worksheet file - there's a little exercise for beginners as well as further **package installation instructions** in there. You definitely need to do the installation part before the workshop (if you don't do that, the workshop would be supremely boring for you, as nothing would work). If you're doing this step at the very last minute, skip the exercise and just do the installation.

# Code troubleshooting

This section contains some basic FAQ and tips. Read through it during package installation. Leave this webpage open - so that if you get stuck or confused while working on an exercise, you can easily come back here and see if it contains a solution for your issue. Reading through this right now might seem a bit pointless at first if you're new to R - but the idea is to have some memory of the common issues in the back of your head, so once you will see you first error message (and you will at some point), it will look familiar and you'll know where the solution can be found.

**Most common issues you will run into as a beginner:**<br>
(it's ok we've all been there)

- **You ran a piece of code but now there's a `+  ` sign on the last line of the Console instead of `>`** and nothing is happening, or weird stuff is happening.
    - Solution. The `+` indicates the Console is expecting more input, but you don't get an explicit error message. It usually means you forgot to close brackets (e.g. `sum(data[1:3 ` ) or have some other typo in the code (`+` at the end of the last ggplot layer maybe?). So whenever you see a lonely + sign in the Console and nothing works anymore, just place the cursor in the Console and press the ESC key in the top left of your keyboard to cancel execution; then find the error in your code (usually  a missing comma or bracket `)` `]` or a trailing `+`) and try again.<br><br>
    ![](../plusesc.png){width=700px} <br><br>

- ***Error in x : could not find function y*** (or something like this)
    - Solution. This kind of error indicates the package is not loaded. Use the relevant `library()` command to load the package that includes the missing function. But it could also be that you misspelled the name of the function. Easy way to check: see if there's a help file for the function you're trying to run (find the Help pane on the right in RStudio). <br><br>
    
- ***Error in library("x") : there is no package called 'x'*** (or something like this)
    - Solution. Either the package is not installed, or you misspelled its name. All the necessary packages should have been installed when you set up for the workshop, and loaded as the first thing in the workshop. If you did not install them (indicated by `library()` giving you a "package not found" error), then go back to that step and install. <br><br>

- ***Error: attempt to use zero-length variable name***
    - Solution. The message is not very helpful but 99% of the time it means that you accidentally executed a line that delineates the code blocks,  the one with ` ``` ` - the common reason being, like with the previous issue, is that you have an unfinished line just before the end of the block, often a missing `)` or an extra `+` at the last line of a ggplot call - just add the missing bracket or remove the trailing `+` and try again. <br><br>

- ***Error ... : argument 2 is empty*** and ***Error: unexpected ... ***
    - Solution: both usually indicate you have an extra comma or a missing comma; look closely at your code and try to find it or ask for help. <br><br>

- **There's a red circle with a white X, or a yellow triangle on the left sidebar, what's that?**
    - Often RStudio detects these errors before you run your code, so if you see this on the left toolbar, look closely at the line of code and try to fix it, or ask for help, or alternatively, comment out the offending line for now by putting a `#` in front of it. <br><br>

- **Plots appear inside the script pane under the code,** instead of the Plots panel on the right, help!
    - Disable inline rendering: Tools -> Global Options -> R Markdown -> disable "Show plots inline..." option.

Also keep this webpage open in your browser during the workshop so you have easy access to these troubleshooting tips! Maybe even have another look at this list of error messages if you happen to have a free moment just before the workshop starts.
